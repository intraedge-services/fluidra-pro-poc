## KPI Coverage Matrix

| # | KPI | Target | Status | Source | Gap |
|---|-----|--------|:------:|--------|-----|
| 1 | Total Active Dealer Accounts (30d/90d/year) | 90% of registered | ✅ FULL | DIM_PRO_BUSINESS_MASTER + DAX (`last_login_date` within period) | None |
| 2 | Total Enrolled Dealers (set up account) | — | ✅ FULL | DIM_PRO_BUSINESS_MASTER (`login_status=ACTIVE`) | None |
| 3 | Total Dealer Accounts Not Set Up | — | ✅ FULL | DIM_PRO_BUSINESS_MASTER (`login_status=PENDING`) | None |
| 4 | Total Inactive Dealers | — | ✅ FULL | DIM + DAX (`login_status=ACTIVE` but `last_login_date` stale) | None |
| 5 | New Dealer Accounts Created (30d/60d/year) | 10% YoY growth | ✅ FULL | FCT_DEALER_EVENTS (`is_created_event=1`) | None |
| 6 | New Technician Accounts Created | 15% YoY growth | ✅ FULL | FCT_CONTACT_EVENTS (`is_created_event=1 AND contact_type='TECHNICIAN'`) | None |
| 7 | Time to Approve Lead | < 24 hours | ✅ FULL | FCT_LEAD_FUNNEL (`seconds_in_stage` for LEAD_APPROVED) | None |
| 8 | Approved Leads to Rewards Activated | < 24 hours | ⚠️ PARTIAL | FCT_LEAD_FUNNEL approval time → DIM `rewards_signup_date` | Gap: `rewards_signup_date` is NULL on many records in QA. Works when populated. |
| 9 | First Login Rate (within 14 days) | > 75% in 7 days | ✅ FULL | FCT_CONTACT_EVENTS (created → login-created time gap) | None — can filter by 7d/14d window |
| 10 | Total Active Users (TAU) (30d/90d/year) | 15% YoY growth | ⚠️ PARTIAL | DIM_PRO_CONTACT_MASTER (`login_status=ACTIVE`) | Gap: `last_login_date` is a snapshot, not real-time. Can approximate but not precise per-period without login event stream. |
| 11 | Total Users Not Set Up | — | ✅ FULL | FCT_CONTACT_EVENTS (created contacts with no login-created event) | None |
| 12 | Total Inactive Users | — | ⚠️ PARTIAL | DIM_PRO_CONTACT_MASTER (`login_status=ACTIVE` + stale `last_login_date`) | Same gap as #10 — snapshot-based |
| 13 | TAU per Dealer Account | ≥ 3 active users | ✅ FULL | BRIDGE + DIM_PRO_CONTACT_MASTER → COUNT per dealer in Power BI | None |
| 14 | Stickiness Ratio — Dealers (WAU/MAU) | > 20% | ❌ GAP | No login frequency data | Need Cognito/Auth0 session events |
| 15 | Stickiness Ratio — Technicians (DAU/MAU) | > 40% | ❌ GAP | No login frequency data | Same as above |
| 16 | Leads Rejection Rate | < 5% (current 70%) | ✅ FULL | FCT_LEAD_FUNNEL (REJECTED / total decisions) | None |
| 17 | Total Revenue — Active Dealers | — | ❌ GAP | No revenue data in Snowflake | Need PSOT revenue feed |
| 18 | Revenue Growth Comparison (Aug 2025 baseline) | — | ❌ GAP | No revenue data | Same as above |

## Out-of-Scope (confirmed excluded)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|:------:|-------|
| Usage Coverage (module adoption) | ❌ Not available | No feature-usage/clickstream data |
| Time to First Value/Action | ❌ Not available | No in-app action tracking |
| Accounts with data discrepancies | ✅ Possible | FCT_RECONCILIATION tracks reconciliation runs. Can derive. |
| Health of EventBus Integration | ✅ Possible | Event volume trends + duplicate rates from staging |

## Gap Summary

### Hard Gaps (Cannot Solve with Current Data)

| Gap | KPIs Blocked | Data Needed | Integration Path |
|-----|:------------:|-------------|-----------------|
| **Login session frequency** | 14, 15 (Stickiness) | Per-login timestamps with user ID | Cognito CloudWatch → S3 → Snowpipe. Join on `cognito_sub_id`. |
| **Revenue/PSOT data** | 17, 18 (Revenue) | Transaction amounts by dealer | Oracle/PSOT extract → S3 → Snowpipe. Join on `fluidra_account_number`. |
| **Platform/device** | Nice-to-have | Web vs mobile identifier | App-level logging or user-agent capture |
| **Sales region** | Nice-to-have | Oracle region assignment | Oracle region table → Snowflake |

### Soft Gaps (Approximation Available)

| Gap | KPIs Affected | Current Approximation | Limitation |
|-----|:------------:|----------------------|-----------|
| `last_login_date` is snapshot | 1, 4, 10, 12 (Active/Inactive) | Use timestamp from business-master events | Only updates when a new event is emitted — not real-time login tracking |
| `rewards_signup_date` sometimes NULL | 8 (Approved → Activation) | Calculate only for records where date exists | Incomplete coverage |
| Guest technician vs regular technician | Scope item | `stg_pro_guest_technicians` exists separately | Need logic to distinguish guest-created vs regular-created |

## Requirement vs Target Comparison

| KPI | Target | Current Measured Value (QA) | Delta |
|-----|--------|:-:|---|
| Active Dealers | 90% of registered | 3% (8/240) | ⚠️ QA data — not representative |
| New Dealers Growth | 10% YoY | N/A (no prior year) | Need baseline |
| New Technicians Growth | 15% YoY | N/A | Need baseline |
| Time to Approve | < 24 hours | 26 seconds avg | ✅ Well within target (QA auto-approve) |
| Approved → Rewards | < 24 hours | Derivable | Need production data |
| First Login Rate | > 75% in 7 days | 36.6% overall | ⚠️ Below target — onboarding friction |
| TAU per Dealer | ≥ 3 users | ~1-2 | ⚠️ Below target |
| Stickiness Dealers | > 20% | N/A (GAP) | Need login stream |
| Stickiness Technicians | > 40% | N/A (GAP) | Need login stream |
| Rejection Rate | < 5% (current 70%) | 0.93% | ✅ Well within target (QA data) |
