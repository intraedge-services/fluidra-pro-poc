## Key Insights from Live Data

### 1. Onboarding is the #1 Problem
- **59% of dealers** (142/240) never completed login setup
- **63% of contacts** (220/347 created) never setup login
- Technicians have the worst rate: only **27.9%** complete login

### 2. Program Activation is Slow
- FLATRATE SERVICEPRO has 73 enrollments but only **13.7% activated**
- 57 dealers stuck in PENDING — potential revenue leak

### 3. Distributor Network Health Varies
- POOLCORP and COVERPOOLS have **70-78% active rates** (healthy)
- ALLIOWA POOLS has 35 dealers but only **31% active** (needs attention)
- COVER POOLS INC has **0% active** — all pending or inactive

### 4. Lead Funnel is Efficient
- Only **0.93% rejection rate** — almost all leads get approved
- **87 creation failures** (all duplicate email) — significant onboarding friction
- 41 GUEST registrations tracked — conversion funnel is measurable
