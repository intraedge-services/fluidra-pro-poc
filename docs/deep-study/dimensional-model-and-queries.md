# Dimensional Model & Analytics Queries

## Overview

This document defines the complete dimensional model for the Fluidra Pro analytics platform,
including dimension tables, fact tables, and metric views — all built from the single source:
`RAW_DB_DEV.FLUIDRAPRO_RAW.EVENTS__RAW_FLUIDRA`.

---

## 1. Data Architecture Layers

```
RAW_DB_DEV.FLUIDRAPRO_RAW.EVENTS__RAW_FLUIDRA (source)
    │
    ▼
STAGING (parsed, deduplicated, typed)
    │
    ▼
DIMENSIONS (conformed, SCD Type 2 where needed)
    │
    ▼
FACTS (event-level grain, measures)
    │
    ▼
METRICS VIEWS (pre-aggregated KPIs)
```

## 2. Staging Layer

### stg_events_parsed (base CTE for all downstream)

```sql
